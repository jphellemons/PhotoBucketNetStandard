# PhotoBucket.Net Standard
## PhotoBucket .Net Standard Library

It's a clone of the old 4 to 6 year old [Photobucket.NET](https://github.com/maschall/Photobucket.NET) So all credit should go to [Maschall](https://github.com/maschall).
I have recompiled it for .Net Standard 1.4 and build a nuget package for it.

I will accept pull requests.

## Install it from Nuget

 Install-Package PhotoBucketNetStandard
